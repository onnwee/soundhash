# Label taxonomy for roadmap

This repository uses bracketed prefixes in issue titles to emulate milestones and priorities, e.g.:

- [M0][P0] Core Stabilization item
- [M1][P1] MVP item

When custom GitHub Labels are added in the future, use these categories:
- priority: P0, P1, P2
- kind: feature, bug, refactor, infra, test, docs, perf, security
- area: ingestion, video-io, fingerprinting, matching, db, api, bots, logging, ci, infra, observability, devx, tooling

Temporary GitHub labels applied now: enhancement, documentation, good first issue, help wanted.
